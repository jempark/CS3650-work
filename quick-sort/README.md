# Quicksort

A C program and an AMD64 assembly program that accepts an array of numbers on its standard input, sorts it, and prints the array to its standard output.

## These arrays are formatted in text as:

1. An ASCII number indicating the size of the array
2. A newline
3. A space separated sequence of ASCII numbers which are the contents of the array.
4. A newline
